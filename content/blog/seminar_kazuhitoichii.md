#### Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is known as important greenhouse gases, and terrestrial
ecosystems play an important role as a CO2 sink. However, the magnitude of the
CO2 budget of terrestrial ecosystem remains uncertain. Challenging toward
accurate estimate with smaller uncertainties are an essential research topic in
earth system science, including atmospheric science and ecosystem science. In
particular, our science community has entered 'data-rich' era. More and more
data, such as a network of site observation data and various satellite-based
observations, have become available for atmospheric-land research. In this
seminar, focusing on the study of material cycle in the atmosphere-land, I will
introduce recently available datasets (e.g., site observation, remote sensing, and
modeling) and how to apply it to carbon cycle research through integration. I will
also show some of the recent studies focusing on changes in terrestrial CO2
budget in responding to climate variation and human effects across Asia.
