**A global simulation of organic aerosols: Implications for climate and air quality**

Recent observations suggest that a certain fraction of organic aerosol (OA) effectively
absorbs solar radiation especially at the visible wavelengths. This OA fraction is called brown
carbon aerosol. However, few global models include this OA species, in which a constant
mass ratio to other carbonaceous species is used to calculate its global concentrations. Here
we provide an explicit global simulation of brown carbon aerosol using the GEOS-Chem
model, driven by the assimilated meteorological data. We first estimate global emissions of
brown carbon aerosol from biofuel use and biomass burning using emission factors
depending on burning efficiencies from the literature. Based on chamber studies, secondary
organic aerosols (SOAs) produced by oxidation of aromatic species are also considered as
brown carbon aerosol in our model. We evaluate our model by comparing with in-situ
observations in the surface air in the U.S. and with absorbing aerosol optical depths at
AERONET sites. The model successfully reproduces the observed seasonal variations but
appears to underestimate the magnitudes especially in the regions where SOAs
concentrations are dominant. Our global simulations show that brown carbon accounts for
about 20% of total organic aerosols, which are previously assumed to be scattering aerosols.
Consideration of solar absorption by brown carbon in the model considerably offsets the
cooling by OA aerosols. In addition, the effect of this absorption on photolysis rates has
caused non-negligible modification of oxidant concentrations especially in East Asia.
