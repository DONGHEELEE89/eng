Entrainment and Mixing in Warm Boundary Layer Clouds: Development and Results of an
Explicit Subgrid-Scale Scheme for Large-Eddy Simulations with Particle-Based Microphysics
To fully understand the microphysical composition of clouds, their radiative properties, and
their ability to precipitate, lengthscales of multiple orders of magnitude need to be considered.
During entrainment, for example, the switch from predominantly inhomogeneous to
homogenous mixing (and their distinct effects on cloud microphysics) takes place at the
centimeter-scale, but standard large-eddy simulations (LES) with grid spacings on the order of
decameters exert erroneous homogeneous mixing over the entire subgrid-scale. On the other

hand, ultra-high resolution direct numerical simulation (DNS) captures the physics of small-
scale mixing correctly, but does not represent the large-scale dynamics of the cloud responsible

for entrainment. The challenge is to represent this range of scales with a single model.
In this talk, a novel modeling approach will be presented in which the LES subgrid-scale is
represented by the ‘linear eddy model’, an economical, one-dimensional model that resolves
turbulent compression, folding, and molecular diffusion in each grid box of the LES explicitly.
Results from test cases of shallow cumuli and stratocumuli are presented, and first applications
for mixed-phase clouds are discussed. Generally, clouds susceptible to inhomogeneous mixing
show a reduction in the droplet number concentration and stronger droplet growth, in
agreement with theory. Stratocumulus entrainment rates tend to be lower in the new approach
compared to simulations without it.
All in all, the simulations presented can be seen as a first step to bridge the gap between DNS
and LES, allowing an appropriate representation of small-scale mixing processes, but also the
consideration of the large-scale cloud system.
