#### Abstract

**Introduction to machine (deep) learning and its application to PM2.5 estimation**

In this talk, I will briefly introduce the main concepts of machine / deep learning within the supervised learning framework. Particularly, the so-called deep learning methods, which use hierarchical neural networks as function approximators, and their recent impacts on various application areas will be introduced. Furthermore, I will talk about some of the recent techniques about interpreting the prediction results of deep neural networks. Finally, I will give some application example of deep learning methods to PM2.5 estimation and show that our recent convolutional neural network-based approach can outperform traditional methods, e.g., random forest, in estimating US conterminous PM2.5 values.~
